				<h2>By-laws</h2>
				<div class="indent">
					<h3 id="voter_limitation_act">Emergency Powers Act</h3>
					<h5><i>Sunday, November 24th, 2013</i></h5>
					<p><b>Purpose:</b> To provide a way to streamline the courts in the event of a emergency situation</p>
					<p><b>Legislation Text:</b></p>
					<p>In the event of the absence of two or more members of the Supreme Court, the WA Delegate may appoint temporary justices to fill the place of the missing members. Appointees must be citizens of the Capitalist Paradise and members of the World Assembly, and can serve as a temporary replacement for no longer than 30 days.</p>
					<p>Absence of a member of the Supreme Court is defined as an inability to contact or receive communications from a member of the court for 7 days after a notice for their presence is made. A notice must be made via telegram.</p>
					<p></p>
					<p><i>Note:</i> If the absent member is the Chief Justice, the senior most member of the court is also the temporary Chief Justice until the Chief Justice returns. If there are no members of the court whatsoever, the WA Delegate may cast a vote as a tie-breaker (but only if needed), and there is no Chief Justice.</p>
					<p>If the member of the Supreme Court returns while the temporary replacement justice is still active, the temporary justice has 48 hours to send all (public and private) court communiques received in the sitting member's absence, and transfer power back to the sitting member in that same time-frame.</p>
